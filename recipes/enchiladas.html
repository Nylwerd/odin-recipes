    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> This recipe comes from mom's heritage. This recipe has been in her
        family for generations. The green chili sauce is a well kept family
        secret until now! Mom makes this specific recipe when she feels like
        the family needs a taste of home, Albuquerque New Mexico, and it does
        not disappoint!
