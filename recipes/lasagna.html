    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> This is mom's favorite lasagna and she has been making this dish for
        a little over 5 years.  This is a staple in the Lynn household and
        when she makes it we are scraping the bottom of the pan.  The best 
        part about this lasagna is the longer it cools the better it becomes!
        Enjoy the mom's best lasagna!
